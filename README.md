I am a B.Tech student in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science, deeply interested in solving complex, real-world problems through analytical thinking and systems-level modeling. My work spans end-to-end simulations, dynamic data visualizations, and exploratory research projects that bring together theory and real-time data to derive deeper insights. I enjoy building solutions that are not only technically sound but also grounded in practical relevance. I’m especially drawn to interdisciplinary challenges—where computation, data, and system behavior converge. I strive to approach every project with clarity, curiosity, and a strong sense of structure. Looking ahead, I’m seeking opportunities that allow me to contribute to applied research, data-centric development, and intelligent decision support in technically challenging domains. I remain open to continuous learning, collaboration, and exploration across diverse problem spaces.
